// Note that for some of these basics we will be observing the output from the
// browser console and at times we will be using node.js

// ****************************************************************************************
// DISPLAY OUTPUT

// Different ways to show output on the browser 
// In your browser, open dev tool and go to console to check out the following output

console.error('This is an error!');

console.warn('this is a warning!');

console.log('this is a console log');

// You can also output using the following but you should avoid it as it suspends loading of rest of the script
//window.alert('Yo how are you doing ?');
