// JS and the DOM -- Will be covered little more in-depth in later lectures 
// DOM tree structure: WINDOW --> DOCUMENT --> ....
// you can do a console log of the window object to see what methods are there 
//console.log(window);
//PROG. NOTE: Alert for example is a part of the window object. So we write window.alert('msg');
// However, since window is the root level of the DOM, even if we don;t include the obj name, its methods will still work: alert('works');


// ELEMENT SELECTORS
